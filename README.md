### SchNet in Jax

**EXPERIMENTAL/IN DEVELOPMENT DO NOT USE YET**

This is a re-implementation of the SchNet neural network architecture in `jax`, using `haiku` and `jax-md`. The re-implementation is intended as a drop-in replacement to the original `pytorch` implementation, allowing the use of trained weights obtained with `schnetpack`.
