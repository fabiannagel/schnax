Example of how to load a "gknet-style" saved SchNet and make a prediction.

Requirements: `schnetpack` (install from github, pypi version is outdated), and `ase`.

Models supplied: `model_n1.torch` and `model_n5.torch`, trained SchNets for ZrO2 with one and five interaction layers.

`geometry.in` is an arbitrary (but physical) configuration of ZrO2 to test things on.
